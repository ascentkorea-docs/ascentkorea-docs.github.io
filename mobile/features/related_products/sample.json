                        "Upgrading from the original Google Pixel (first gen), I am ASTOUNDED by Samsung's superiority in the smart phone market. I purchased Samsung's Galaxy S 21 FE 5G (256gb graphite) on sale from Samsung.com for about $150 off, making it an even better deal. As a computer scientists and photographer, I use and appreciate the countless features Samsung phones have very day. Photography wise, I appreciate the options to change the ISO, shutter speed, focus and white balance manually on pro mode. I can also set the camera to save images in RAW format in the camera settings, which drastically helps post-image editing, especially for astrophotography. Using my Samsung camera almost feels like using a professional DSLR or mirrorless camera because of the customizable camera features and striking quality. I use these features to take incredible pictures of everything from the Milky Way/night sky to portraits of my loved ones and time lapses of the clouds. For such a low price, no other company could possibly beat Samsung's edge on advanced technology and superior features. The under - display fingerprint sensor is lightning quick and very useful, and the overall design is very pleasing. To this day, even after having it for months, everytime I look at at my phone I notice how beautiful of a phone it is; it looks like a meticulously crafted expensive piece of jewelry. Others seem to think so, too, because I get compliments on it's look all the time. I don't understand why anyone would choose not to buy a Samsung phone because they're the best on the market, especially for their price. In fact, just yesterday one of my iPhone using friends' phone died, and when I showed her I could charge it with my phone by just putting their backs together using the power share feature, she was utterly shocked that such \"futuristic\" and \"amazing\" technology existed. She even said she wanted to buy a Samsung smartphone just for that feature. Little does she know, although, about the countless other amazing features that she would discover about Samsungs if she did so; features like Dolby Atmos, multi device connectivity in 'media output' settings, the highly customizable and adaptable Samsung keyboard, etc.. Overall, the Galaxy S21 FE is an incredible phone that I highly recommend, especially for the price. In fact, I recommend any Samsung s-series or z-sries phone in general because you cant go wrong with them. The numberless unique features that you will continue to discover about your Samsung phone months later is only one of the many experiences Samung users get that its competitors don't. If you're a photographer, Samsung is definitely the best way to go as it has highly versatile camera features that other companies lack. You can never go wrong with a Samsung.

                        "Upgrading from the original Google Pixel (first gen), I am ASTOUNDED by Samsung's superiority in the smart phone market. I purchased Samsung's Galaxy S 21 FE 5G (256gb graphite) on sale from Samsung.com for about $150 off, making it an even better deal. As a computer scientists and photographer, I use and appreciate the countless features Samsung phones have very day. Photography wise, I appreciate the options to change the ISO, shutter speed, focus and white balance manually on pro mode. I can also set the camera to save images in RAW format in the camera settings, which drastically helps post-image editing, especially for astrophotography. Using my Samsung camera almost feels like using a professional DSLR or mirrorless camera because of the customizable camera features and striking quality. I use these features to take incredible pictures of everything from the Milky Way/night sky to portraits of my loved ones and time lapses of the clouds. For such a low price, no other company could possibly beat Samsung's edge on advanced technology and superior features. The under - display fingerprint sensor is lightning quick and very useful, and the overall design is very pleasing. To this day, even after having it for months, everytime I look at at my phone I notice how beautiful of a phone it is; it looks like a meticulously crafted expensive piece of jewelry. Others seem to think so, too, because I get compliments on it's look all the time. I don't understand why anyone would choose not to buy a Samsung phone because they're the best on the market, especially for their price. In fact, just yesterday one of my iPhone using friends' phone died, and when I showed her I could charge it with my phone by just putting their backs together using the power share feature, she was utterly shocked that such \"futuristic\" and \"amazing\" technology existed. She even said she wanted to buy a Samsung smartphone just for that feature. Little does she know, although, about the countless other amazing features that she would discover about Samsungs if she did so; features like Dolby Atmos, multi device connectivity in 'media output' settings, the highly customizable and adaptable Samsung keyboard, etc.. Overall, the Galaxy S21 FE is an incredible phone that I highly recommend, especially for the price. In fact, I recommend any Samsung s-series or z-sries phone in general because you cant go wrong with them. The numberless unique features that you will continue to discover about your Samsung phone months later is only one of the many experiences Samung users get that its competitors don't. If you're a photographer, Samsung is definitely the best way to go as it has highly versatile camera features that other companies lack. You can never go wrong with a Samsung. All of the attached photos were taken by me on my Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G",

                        "Upgrading from the original Google Pixel (first gen), I am ASTOUNDED by Samsung's superiority in the smart phone market. I purchased Samsung's Galaxy S 21 FE 5G (256gb graphite) on sale from Samsung.com for about $150 off, making it an even better deal. As a computer scientists and photographer, I use and appreciate the countless features Samsung phones have very day. Photography wise, I appreciate the options to change the ISO, shutter speed, focus and white balance manually on pro mode. I can also set the camera to save images in RAW format in the camera settings, which drastically helps post-image editing, especially for astrophotography. Using my Samsung camera almost feels like using a professional DSLR or mirrorless camera because of the customizable camera features and striking quality. I use these features to take incredible pictures of everything from the Milky Way/night sky to portraits of my loved ones and time lapses of the clouds. For such a low price, no other company could possibly beat Samsung's edge on advanced technology and superior features. The under - display fingerprint sensor is lightning quick and very useful, and the overall design is very pleasing. To this day, even after having it for months, everytime I look at at my phone I notice how beautiful of a phone it is; it looks like a meticulously crafted expensive piece of jewelry. Others seem to think so, too, because I get compliments on it's look all the time. I don't understand why anyone would choose not to buy a Samsung phone because they're the best on the market, especially for their price. In fact, just yesterday one of my iPhone using friends' phone died, and when I showed her I could charge it with my phone by just putting their backs together using the power share feature, she was utterly shocked that such \"futuristic\" and \"amazing\" technology existed. She even said she wanted to buy a Samsung smartphone just for that feature. Little does she know, although, about the countless other amazing features that she would discover about Samsungs if she did so; features like Dolby Atmos, multi device connectivity in 'media output' settings, the highly customizable and adaptable Samsung keyboard, etc.. Overall, the Galaxy S21 FE is an incredible phone that I highly recommend, especially for the price. In fact, I recommend any Samsung s-series or z-sries phone in general because you cant go wrong with them. The numberless unique features that you will continue to discover about your Samsung phone months later is only one of the many experiences Samung users get that its competitors don't. If you're a photographer, Samsung is definitely the best way to go as it has highly versatile camera features that other companies lack. You can never go wrong with a Samsung. All of the attached photos were taken by me on my Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G",
